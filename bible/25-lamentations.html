			<h2>Lamentations</h2>


			<h4 id="lamentations-1">1</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> How the city sits alone / That was full of people! / She who was <i>once</i> great among the nations / Has become like a widow; / She who was a princess among the provinces / Has become tributary.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> Bitterly she weeps in the night, / And her tears are on her cheeks. / There is no one to comfort her / Among all her lovers; / All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; / They have become her enemies.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Judah has gone into exile, away from affliction / And away from great servitude; / She dwells among the nations / <i>But</i> finds no rest; / All her pursuers have overtaken her / In the midst of distress.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> The ways of Zion mourn, / For no one comes to the appointed feast; / All her gates are desolate; / Her priests groan; / Her virgins are afflicted, / And she is in bitterness.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Her adversaries have become the head; / Her enemies prosper; / For Jehovah has afflicted her / Because of the multitude of her transgressions; / Her little ones have gone into captivity / Before the adversary.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And all her majesty has departed / From the daughter of Zion; / Her princes have become like deer / That find no pasture, / And they have fled without strength / Before the pursuer.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> In the days of her affliction and her wanderings, / Jerusalem remembers / All her precious things / Which were in the days of old, / When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, / And there was no one to help her. / The adversaries saw her; / They mocked at her downfall.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Jerusalem has sinned grievously; / Therefore she has become an impurity. / All who honored her despise her, / Because they have seen her nakedness; / And she groans / And turns backwards.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Her uncleanness is in her skirts; / She did not remember her latter end; / Therefore she has come down astonishingly; / There is no one to comfort her. / O Jehovah, see my affliction, / For the enemy has magnified himself.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> The adversary has spread out his hand / Over all her precious things, / For she has seen the nations / Enter her sanctuary, / <i>Concerning</i> whom You commanded that they should not enter / Into Your assembly.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> All her people groan; / They seek bread;They have given their precious things for food / To restore their soul. / See, O Jehovah, and look, / For I have become despised.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Is it nothing to you, all who pass by the way? / Look and see / If there is any pain like my pain / Which is dealt to me, / Whom Jehovah has afflicted / In the day of His burning anger.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> He has sent fire from on high / Into my bones, and it prevails <i>against them;</i> / He has spread out a net for my feet; / He has turned me back; / He has made me a desolation / <i>And</i> faint all the day.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand; / They are knit together; / They have come up upon my neck; / He has made my strength fail; / The Lord has delivered me into hands / From which I am not able to rise up.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> The Lord has made light of all my mighty men / In my midst; / He has called an assembly against me / To crush my young men. / The Lord has trodden, <i>as in</i> a winepress, / The virgin daughter of Judah.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> For these things I weep; / My eye, my eye runs down with water, / For the comforter who should revive my soul / Is far from me; / My children have become desolate, / Because the enemy has prevailed.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Zion stretches out her hands, / <i>Yet</i> there is no one to comfort her. / Jehovah has commanded concerning Jacob / That those around him should be his adversaries; / Jerusalem has become an impurity / Among them.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Jehovah is righteous, / For I have rebelled against His commandment. / Hear now, all the peoples, / And see my pain; / My virgins and my young men / Have gone into captivity.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> I have called to my lovers; / They have deceived me; / My priests and my elders / Have perished in the city, / While they sought food for themselves / To restore their souls.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> See, O Jehovah, for I am in distress, / My bowels are in ferment; / My heart is overturned within me, / For I have been very rebellious. / In the street the sword bereaves; / In the house it is like death.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> They have heard that I groan; / There is no one to comfort me; / All my enemies have heard of my trouble; / They are glad that You have done <i>it.</i> / You will bring the day that You have proclaimed, / And they will be like me.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Let all their wickedness come before You, / And deal with them / As You have dealt with me / For all my transgressions; / For my sighs are many, / And my heart is faint.<br>

			<h4 id="lamentations-2">2</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> How the Lord in His anger / Has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud! / He has cast from heaven to earth / The glory of Israel, / And has not remembered His footstool / In the day of His anger.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob; / He has not spared; / He has torn down in His overflowing wrath / The strongholds of the daughter of Judah. / He has brought <i>them</i> down to the ground; / He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> He has cut off in fierce anger / All the horn of Israel.He has withdrawn His right hand / From before the enemy. / He has burned among Jacob like a flame of fire; / It consumes all around.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> He has bent His bow like an enemy; / He has set His right hand like an adversary / And has slain all that was pleasant to the eye. / In the tent of the daughter of Zion / He has poured out His wrath like fire.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> The Lord has become like an enemy; / He has swallowed up Israel; / He has swallowed up all her palaces; / He has destroyed her strongholds / And multiplied in the daughter of Judah / Mourning and lamentation.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And He has violently taken away His pavilion like a garden; / He has destroyed the place of His assembly; / Jehovah has caused the appointed feast and the Sabbath / To be forgotten in Zion; / He has despised, in the indignation of His anger, / The king and the priest.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> The Lord has cast off His altar; / He has abhorred His sanctuary; / He has delivered up into the hand of the enemy / The walls of her palaces. / They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah / As though it were the day of an appointed feast.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Jehovah has thought to destroy / The walls of the daughter of Zion; / He has stretched out the line / And has not withdrawn His hand from destroying; / And He has made the rampart and the wall to mourn; / They languish together.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Her gates have sunk into the ground; / He has destroyed and broken her bars; / Her king and her princes are among nations / Where there is no law; / Her prophets also do not find / A vision from Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> The elders of the daughter of Zion / Sit on the ground; they are silent. / They have cast dust upon their head; / They have girded themselves with sackcloth. / The virgins of Jerusalem / Hang down their head to the ground.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> My eyes are consumed with tears; / My bowels are in ferment; / My liver is poured out on the earth, / Because of the brokenness of the daughter of my people, / Because the little ones and the nursing children / Faint in the streets of the city.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> They say to their mothers, / Where is the grain and the wine? / When they faint like one wounded / In the streets of the city, / When they pour out their soul / Into their mothersâ€™ bosom.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> What shall I testify to you? What shall I liken you to, / O daughter of Jerusalem? / What shall I compare you to, that I may comfort you, / O virgin daughter of Zion? / For your breach is great like a sea. / Who will heal you?<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> Your prophets have seen for you / Vanity and folly, / And they have not uncovered your iniquity / To turn again your captivity; / But they have seen for you burdens / Of vanity and of <i>causes of</i> banishment.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> All those who pass on the way / Clap their hands at you; / They hiss and wag their head / At the daughter of Jerusalem, <i>saying,</i> / Is this the city which they called, / The perfection of beauty, / The joy of the whole earth?<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> All your enemies / Have opened their mouth against you; / They hiss and gnash the teeth; / They say, We have swallowed <i>her</i> up. / This is certainly the day that we have looked for; / We have found <i>it;</i> we have seen <i>it.</i><br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Jehovah has done what He purposed; / He has fulfilled His word, / Which He commanded from the days of old; / He has torn down and has not spared, / And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; / He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Their heart cried out to the Lord: / O wall of the daughter of Zion, / Let tears run down like a stream / Day and night; / Give yourself no respite; / Let not the pupil of your eye cease.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Arise, cry out in the night / At the beginning of the watches; / Pour out your heart like water / Before the face of the Lord; / Lift up your hands toward Him / For the life of your little ones, / Who faint because of famine / At the head of every street.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> See, O Jehovah, and look, / With whom You have dealt thus? / Shall the women eat their fruit, / The little ones nursed <i>by them?</i> / Shall the priest and the prophet be slain / In the sanctuary of the Lord?<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> The youth and the old man / Lie on the ground in the streets; / My virgins and my young men / Have fallen by the sword; / You have slain them in the day of Your anger; / You have slaughtered; You have not spared.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> You have called for, as though in the day of an appointed feast, / My terrors on every side, / And in the day of Jehovahâ€™s anger / There was none who escaped or remained; / Those whom I have nursed and brought up / My enemy has consumed.<br>

			<h4 id="lamentations-3">3</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> I am the man who has seen affliction / By the rod of His wrath.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> He has driven me and brought me / Into darkness and not light.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Surely against me He has turned His hand / Again and again all the day.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> He has wasted my flesh and my skin; / He has broken my bones.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> He has built up <i>a siege</i> against me / And encircled me with gall and travail.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> He has made me dwell in dark places, / Like those who have long been dead.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> He has walled me about so that I cannot go forth; / He has made my bronze chain heavy.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Indeed, when I cry out and call for help, / He shuts out my prayer.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> He has walled in my ways with hewn stone; / He has made my paths crooked.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> He is to me like a bear lying in wait, / Like a lion in hidden places.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces; / He has made me desolate.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> He bent His bow / And set me as a target for the arrow.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> He has caused the arrows of His quiver / To enter my inward parts.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> I have become a derision to all my people, / Their <i>mocking</i> song all the day.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> He has filled me with bitterness; / He has made me drunk with wormwood.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> He has also crushed my teeth with gravel; / He has covered me with ashes.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> And You have removed my soul far from peace; / I have forgotten prosperity.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> And I said, My strength has perished / As well as my hope in Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Remember my affliction and my wandering, / The wormwood and the gall.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> My soul remembers <i>them</i> well / And is bowed down within me.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> This I recall to my heart; / Therefore I have hope.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> <i>It is</i> Jehovahâ€™s lovingkindness that we are not consumed, / For His compassions do not fail;<br>
				 <sup>23</sup> They are new every morning; / Great is Your faithfulness.<br>
				 <sup>24</sup> Jehovah is my portion, says my soul; / Therefore I hope in Him.<br>
				 <sup>25</sup> Jehovah is good to those who wait on Him, / To the soul that seeks Him.<br>
				 <sup>26</sup> It is good for one to hope, and <i>to do so</i> in silence, / For the salvation of Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>27</sup> It is good for a man to bear / The yoke in his youth.<br>
				 <sup>28</sup> Let him sit alone and be silent, / Because He has laid <i>it</i> upon him.<br>
				 <sup>29</sup> Let him put his mouth in the dust â€” / Perhaps there is hope.<br>
				 <sup>30</sup> Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him; / Let him be filled with reproach.<br>
				 <sup>31</sup> For the Lord will not / Cast off forever.<br>
				 <sup>32</sup> But even if He causes grief, He will have compassion / According to the multitude of His lovingkindness;<br>
				 <sup>33</sup> For He does not afflict willingly / Or grieve the children of men.<br>
				 <sup>34</sup> The crushing under his foot / Of all the prisoners of the earth,<br>
				 <sup>35</sup> The turning aside of the justice due a man / Before the face of the Most High,<br>
				 <sup>36</sup> The wronging of a man in his cause â€” / Will not the Lord see <i>all these?</i><br>
				 <sup>37</sup> Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, / What the Lord has not commanded?<br>
				 <sup>38</sup> Out of the mouth of the Most High / Do there not proceed evil things and something good?<br>
				 <sup>39</sup> Why does a living man complain, / A man for the punishment of his sins?<br>
				 <sup>40</sup> Let us examine our ways and try <i>them,</i> / And let us turn again to Jehovah.<br>
				 <sup>41</sup> Let us lift up our heart with <i>our</i> hands / Unto God in the heavens.<br>
				 <sup>42</sup> We have transgressed and rebelled; / You have not pardoned.<br>
				 <sup>43</sup> You have covered <i>Yourself</i> with anger and have pursued us; / You have slain; You have not spared.<br>
				 <sup>44</sup> You have covered Yourself with a cloud / That prayer might not pass through.<br>
				 <sup>45</sup> You have made us offscouring and refuse / In the midst of the peoples.<br>
				 <sup>46</sup> All our enemies have opened / Their mouths against us.<br>
				 <sup>47</sup> Fear and the pit are upon us, / Devastation and destruction.<br>
				 <sup>48</sup> My eye runs down with streams of water / For the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br>
				 <sup>49</sup> My eye pours forth and does not stop; / There is no cessation,<br>
				 <sup>50</sup> Until Jehovah looks down / And sees from the heavens.<br>
				 <sup>51</sup> My eye pains my soul / Because of all the daughters of my city.<br>
				 <sup>52</sup> They have hunted me down like a bird, / <i>They who are</i> my enemies without cause.<br>
				 <sup>53</sup> They have brought my life to its end in the pit / And have thrown a stone upon me.<br>
				 <sup>54</sup> Water streamed over my head; / I said, I have been cut off.<br>
				 <sup>55</sup> I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, / From the lowest pit.<br>
				 <sup>56</sup> You have heard my voice; do not hide / Your ear at my breathing, at my cry.<br>
				 <sup>57</sup> You drew near in the day that I called upon You; / You said, Do not fear.<br>
				 <sup>58</sup> Lord, You have pleaded my soulâ€™s case; / You have redeemed my life.<br>
				 <sup>59</sup> You have seen, O Jehovah, my oppression; / Judge my cause.<br>
				 <sup>60</sup> You have seen all their vengeance, / All their plans, against me.<br>
				 <sup>61</sup> You have heard their reproach, O Jehovah, / All their plans against me,<br>
				 <sup>62</sup> The lips of those who rise up against me / And their meditation against me all the day.<br>
				 <sup>63</sup> Look upon their sitting down and their rising up; / I am their mocking song.<br>
				 <sup>64</sup> You will render to them a recompense, O Jehovah, / According to the work of their hands.<br>
				 <sup>65</sup> You will give them hardness of heart; / Your curse be upon them.<br>
				 <sup>66</sup> You will pursue them in anger and will destroy them / From under the heavens of Jehovah.<br>

			<p><sup>1</sup> How the gold has become dim! / <i>How</i> the most pure gold has changed! / The stones of the sanctuary lie poured out / At the head of every street.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> The precious sons of Zion, / Comparable to fine gold, / How they are esteemed as earthen pitchers, / The work of the hands of a potter.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Even the jackals present the breast; / They nurse their young ones; / <i>But</i> the daughter of my people has become cruel, / Like the ostriches in the wilderness.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> The tongue of the sucking child cleaves / To the roof of his mouth for thirst; / The little ones ask for bread, / <i>But</i> no one breaks <i>it</i> for them.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Those who fed on delicacies / Are desolate in the streets; / Those who were brought up in scarlet / Embrace dung heaps.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater / Than the sin of Sodom, / Which was overthrown as in a moment; / And no hands were laid on her.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Her nobles were purer than snow; / They were whiter than milk; / They were redder in body than corals; / Their figure was like sapphire.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Their visage is darker than black <i>coal;</i> / They are not recognized in the streets. / Their skin has shriveled up on their bones; / It has dried up; it has become like wood.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Those who were slain by the sword are better / Than those slain by famine; / For these pine away stricken through, / Because of the lack of the produce of the field.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> The hands of compassionate women / Have boiled their own children; / They have become their food / In the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Jehovah has accomplished His wrath; / He has poured out His burning anger. / And He has kindled a fire in Zion, / And it has consumed its foundations.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> The kings of the earth did not believe, / Neither did any of the inhabitants of the world, / That the adversary and the enemy would enter / Into the gates of Jerusalem.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> It is because of the sins of her prophets, / <i>And</i> the iniquities of her priests, / Who have shed the blood of the righteous / In her midst.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> They have wandered about blind in the streets; / They are polluted with blood; / So that men cannot touch / Their garments.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> They cried out to them, Depart! Unclean! / Depart, depart; do not touch! / When they fled away and wandered about, men said among the nations, / They will no longer sojourn <i>there.</i><br>
				 <sup>16</sup> The anger of Jehovah has scattered them; / He will no longer regard them. / They did not honor the priests, / Nor did they favor the elders.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Our eyes do yet fail, / <i>Looking</i> in vain for our help; / In our watching we watched / For a nation that could not save.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> They hunted our steps, / So that we cannot walk in our streets; / Our end drew near; our days were fulfilled; / For our end had come.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Our pursuers were swifter / Than the eagles of heaven; / They hotly pursued us on the mountains; / They lay in wait for us in the wilderness.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, / Has been captured in their pits, / Of whom we said, Under his shadow / We will live among the nations.<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, / Who dwells in the land of Uz. / <i>Yet</i> the cup will pass through to you also; / You will become drunk and make yourself naked.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> <i>The punishment for</i> your iniquity has been accomplished, O daughter of Zion; / He will no longer take you into exile. / <i>But</i> He will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; / He will uncover your sins.<br>

			<h4 id="lamentations-5">5</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> Remember, O Jehovah, what has come upon us; / Look and see our reproach.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, / Our houses to foreigners.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> We are orphans without father; / Our mothers are like widows.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> We have drunk our water for money; / Our wood comes <i>to us</i> at a price.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> On our necks are our pursuers; / We are weary; we have no rest.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> We have given <i>our</i> hand to Egypt / And to Assyria, so as to be satisfied with bread.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Our fathers sinned <i>and</i> they are not, / And we ourselves bear their iniquities.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Slaves rule over us; / There is no one to deliver <i>us</i> from their hand.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> We get our bread at the risk of our lives / Because of the sword from the wilderness.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Our skin is black like an oven / Because of the burning heat of famine.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> They have ravished the women in Zion, / The virgins in the cities of Judah.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Princes were hanged by them. / The faces of the elders were not honored.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> The young men bore the mill, / And the young boys stumbled under the wood.<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> The old men have ceased from the gate, / The young men from their music.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> The joy of our heart has ceased; / Our dance has been turned into mourning.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> The crown has fallen from our head. / Woe to us! For we have sinned.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Because of this our heart is faint; / Because of these things our eyes are dim;<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Because of Mount Zion, which is desolate â€” / Foxes rove in it.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> You, O Jehovah, abide forever; / Your throne is from generation to generation.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> Why do You forget us forever / And forsake us for so long a time?<br>
				 <sup>21</sup> Turn us back to You, O Jehovah, and we will be turned; / Renew our days as before.<br>
				 <sup>22</sup> Or have You utterly rejected us? / Are You exceedingly angry with us?<br>
