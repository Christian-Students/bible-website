			<h2>2 John</h2>

			<h4 id="2john-1">1</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> The elder to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in truthfulness, and not only I but also all those who know the truth,<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> For the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> And now I ask you, lady, not as writing a new commandment to you but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you walk in love.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> For many deceivers went out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Look to yourselves that you do not lose the things which we wrought, but that you may receive a full reward.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink, but I am hoping to be with you and to speak face to face that our joy may be made full.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> The children of your chosen sister greet you. <br>
