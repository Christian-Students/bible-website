			<h2>Habakkuk</h2>


			<h4 id="habakkuk-1">1</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> How long, O Jehovah, shall I cry / And You do not hear? / I cry out to You, Violence! / And You do not save.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> Why do You cause me to see iniquity / And look upon wrong? / Indeed destruction and violence are before me; / And there is strife, and contention arises.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> Therefore the law is ineffective, / And justice never goes forth; / For the wicked encompasses the righteous, / Therefore justice goes forth perverted.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Look among the nations, and see, / And be amazed, utterly amazed. / For I am doing a work in your days / <i>Which</i> you would not believe if it were told <i>you.</i><br>
				 <sup>6</sup> For I am about to raise up the Chaldeans, / That bitter and hasty nation / That marches through the breadth of the earth / To possess habitations that are not theirs.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> They are terrible and dreadful; / Their judgment and their authority issue from themselves.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> And their horses are swifter than leopards / And more agile than the wolves of evening. / And their horsemen prance about; / Indeed their horsemen come from afar; / They fly like an eagle that hastens to devour.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> All of them come to do violence; / The set of their faces is forward, / And they gather captives like sand.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> Indeed they scoff at kings, / And potentates are a derision to them; / They deride every fortress, / For they heap up dirt and take it.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Then they will sweep through <i>like</i> the wind and pass over / And thus become guilty; this — their strength — is their god.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Are You not from everlasting, O Jehovah, / My God, my Holy One? We will not die. / O Jehovah, You have appointed them for judgment; / And You, O Rock, have established them for correction.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> You who are of purer eyes than to behold evil / And who cannot look upon wrong, / Why do You look upon them who deal treacherously / <i>And</i> keep silent when the wicked man swallows up him who is more righteous than he?<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> And You make man like the fish of the sea, / Like the creeping things, who have no one to rule for them.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> They take all of them up with a hook; / They drag them off in their net / And gather them into their seine; / So they rejoice and exult.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> Therefore they offer sacrifices to their net / And burn incense to their seine, / For by them their portion is fat / And their food is plenteous.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> Will they then empty their net / And continually slay the nations without sparing?<br>
			</p>

			<h4 id="habakkuk-2">2</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> I will stand at my watch / And station myself on the fortress, / And I will watch to see what He will speak to me / And what I will reply concerning my complaint.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> Then Jehovah answered me and said, / Write the vision, and render <i>it</i> plainly upon tablets, / That <i>even</i> he who runs by may read it.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> For the vision is yet for the appointed time, / And it hastens toward the end and will not lie. / Though it tarries, wait for it; / For it will surely come; it will not delay.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> See, he who is puffed up, his soul is not upright within him, / But the righteous one will live by his faith.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Furthermore <i>his</i> wine is treacherous: / A boasting man, he does not abide at home, / He who enlarges his appetite like Sheol, / And is like death and cannot be satisfied, / But gathers to himself all the nations / And collects for himself all the peoples.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Will not all of these take up a parable against him, / Indeed a mocking song <i>and</i> a riddle against him, and say, / Woe to him who increases what is not his (For how long?) / And who loads himself with the burden of pledges?<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> Will not those who bite you rise up suddenly, / And those who shake you awake, / And you will become booty to them?<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Because you have plundered many nations; / All the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, / Because of the bloodshed of men and the violence <i>done</i> to the land, / To the city, and to all the inhabitants in it.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Woe to him who by violence takes evil gain for his house, / So as to place his nest on high / That he may be delivered from the hand of evil!<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> You have devised shame against your own house / By cutting off many peoples, / And have sinned against your own soul.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> For the stone will cry out from the wall, / And the rafter will answer it from the timber.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> Woe to him who builds a city by bloodshed / And establishes a town by iniquity!<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> Indeed is it not of Jehovah of hosts / That the peoples toil for the fire / And the nations weary themselves for vanity?<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> For the earth will be filled / With the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah / As water covers the sea.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> Woe to him who makes his neighbor drink, / Adding in his poison, / And also making <i>him</i> drunk / In order to look at their nakedness!<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> You are sated with shame, not glory. / You also, drink and be shown to be uncircumcised! / The cup of Jehovah’s right hand will come around to you, / And disgrace will be upon your glory.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> For the violence <i>done</i> to Lebanon will cover you, / As well as the destruction of the beasts which frightened them, / Because of the bloodshed of men and the violence <i>done</i> to the land, / To the city, and to all the inhabitants in it.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> What profit is the graven idol that its maker should engrave it, / <i>Or</i> the molten idol, even the teacher of lies, / That he who forms its form depends on it / To make dumb idols?<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Woe to him who says to wood, Awake! / <i>And,</i> Arise! to silent stone. / Will it teach <i>him?</i> / Behold, it is set in gold and silver, / And there is no breath at all within it.<br>
				 <sup>20</sup> But Jehovah is in His holy temple: / Be silent before Him, all the earth!<br>

			<h4 id="habakkuk-3">3</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet in shigionoth.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> O Jehovah, I have heard the report concerning You <i>and</i> am afraid. / O Jehovah, revive Your work / In the midst of the years; / In the midst of the years make <i>it</i> known; / In wrath remember compassion.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> God comes from Teman, / Even the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah / His splendor covers the heavens, / And the earth is filled with His praise.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> And <i>His</i> brightness is like the light: / Rays <i>come forth</i> from His hand, / And the hiding of His power is there.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Before Him goes pestilence, / And the fire bolt comes forth at His feet.<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> He stands and measures the earth; / He looks and startles the nations; / And the ancient mountains are shattered into dust, / And the everlasting hills sink down; / His goings are eternal.<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> I see the tents of Cushan / Under affliction; / The tent curtains of the land of Midian tremble.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> Is it against the rivers, O Jehovah, / Against the rivers that Your anger is kindled? / Is Your overflowing wrath against the sea / That You ride upon Your horses, / Upon Your chariots of salvation?<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> Your bow is bared utterly; / The rods <i>of discipline</i> are sworn according to <i>Your</i> word. Selah / You cleave the earth with rivers.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> The mountains see You; they writhe; / The tempest of water passes by; / The deep utters its voice, / It lifts its hands high.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> The sun <i>and</i> the moon stand still in their high abode / At the light of Your arrows going forth, / At the brightness of Your glittering spear.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> In wrath You march through the earth, / In anger You thresh the nations.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> You go forth for the salvation of Your people, / For the salvation of Your anointed one, / You strike the head from the house of the wicked one, / Laying bare the foundation, even to the neck. Selah<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> You pierce, with his own staves, / The heads of his warriors. / They come out like a whirlwind to scatter me; / Their exultation is as if to devour the poor in secret.<br>
				 <sup>15</sup> You tread the sea with Your horses, / The heap of mighty waters.<br>
				 <sup>16</sup> I heard and my body trembled; / My lips quivered at the sound. / Rottenness entered my bones, / And I tremble in my place, / Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress, / When he who attacks us comes up against the people.<br>
				 <sup>17</sup> For the fig tree will not sprout, / And there will be no yield on the vines; / The labor on the olive tree will fail, / And the fields will make no food; / The flock will be cut off from the fold, / And there will be no herd in the stalls.<br>
				 <sup>18</sup> Yet I will exult in Jehovah; / I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.<br>
				 <sup>19</sup> Jehovah the Lord is my strength; / And He makes my feet like hinds’ <i>feet</i> / And will cause me to walk on my high places. / For the choir director, with my stringed instruments.<br>
