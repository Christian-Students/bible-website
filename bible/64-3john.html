			<h2>3 John</h2>

			<h4 id="3john-1">1</h4>
			<p><sup>1</sup> The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truthfulness.<br>
				 <sup>2</sup> Beloved, concerning all things I wish that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.<br>
				 <sup>3</sup> For I rejoiced greatly at the brothersâ€™ coming and testifying to your steadfastness in the truth, even as you walk in truth.<br>
				 <sup>4</sup> I have no greater joy than these things, that I hear that my children are walking in the truth.<br>
				 <sup>5</sup> Beloved, you do faithfully in whatever you have wrought for the brothers, and this for strangers,<br>
				 <sup>6</sup> Who testified to your love before the church; whom you will do well to send forward in a manner worthy of God;<br>
				 <sup>7</sup> For on behalf of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.<br>
				 <sup>8</sup> We therefore ought to support such ones that we may become fellow workers in the truth.<br>
				 <sup>9</sup> I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us.<br>
				 <sup>10</sup> For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words; and not being satisfied with these, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbids and casts out of the church.<br>
				 <sup>11</sup> Beloved, do not imitate the evil, but the good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen God.<br>
				 <sup>12</sup> To Demetrius testimony has been borne by all and by the truth itself; and we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.<br>
				 <sup>13</sup> I had many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with ink and pen;<br>
				 <sup>14</sup> But I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face. Peace to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name. <br>
